                        <p>Welcome to my e-portfolio! This is an online collection to showcase my academic and professional accomplishments, 
                            as well as my personal interests and experiences. My name is Murtaza Warraich, I am originally from Pakistan and my parents immigrated here for a better life.
                            I have been attending York University since 2019 and I am pursing a degree in Information technology. 
                            From a young age, I was captivated by the world of technology, and this passion has only grown stronger with time. 
                            My journey into the realm of technology began with my fascination for electronic gadgets like my $20 helicopter and computer games such as my 2008 sony psp.
                            This quickly evolved into a deep-seated curiosity about how they worked and a desire to create and innovate.
                            My passion for technology has driven me to pursue a career in this field, and I see myself continuing to thrive in it. 
                            I view technology as a dynamic and ever-evolving domain that offers endless opportunities for innovation and problem-solving. 
                            Whether it's developing cutting-edge software, designing user-friendly interfaces, or contributing to groundbreaking research
                            I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact through technology and look forward to the exciting journey ahead.</p>
